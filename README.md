## Dive into Deep Learning — Karl's Study Guide 👋🏽

This repo is both my personal study log and a reproducible guide for anyone rebuilding their ML/AI foundations. After years in product/business roles at Microsoft, I realized I needed to strengthen my CS/math fundamentals to prepare for a Master’s-level AI program. If you’ve stepped away from core CS but want to re-engage with structure and momentum, this path might help you too.

This repository is my way to:
1. Show gratitude by showcasing the work.  
2. Re-learn fundamentals to prepare for a Master’s-level AI program.  
3. Leave a clear, reproducible path for others returning after a gap.

## What this repo contains 📚
I’m following the open textbook **[Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)](https://d2l.ai/)** and capturing both my understanding and runnable examples along the way. It has...
- 🧠 Notes (`notes/`) — chapter summaries in my own words  
- 🧪 Tiny runnable exercises (`exercises/`) — small PyTorch/Python demos  
- 📈 Progress tracking — each chapter = notes + exercise + PR  

<br>
Here are some quick links to my notes and resouces I've created (currently WIP 😁)

| # | Section | Resource | Status   |
|---|---------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Introduction | [here](notebooks/00_introduction.ipynb) | Complete |
| 2 | Preliminaries | [WIP](notebooks/02_preliminaries.ipynb)  | In Progress |
| 3 | Linear Neural Networks for Regression | 🤘🏽 Coming Soon! | Not Started |

## Quickstart (reproduce locally) 🚀
